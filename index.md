## Welcome to Mineglory
Mineglory is planned to be a moba server for Minecraft following the gameplay elements of Games like League of Legends or VainGlory.   
### Why does the IP change a lot?

We don't take any money from you, everyone gets the same gameplay experience without buying any pay to win crates. That's why we have to rely on free hosting services. We'd have to pay about 5$ per month per server instance to get static ip's which is in my oppinion not worth it. If we're one day opeing a patreon, all the money goes into better hositng options first. 

### Not-Even-Alpha
This server is more than unfinished. The map is about 20% complete and there's currently no working teaming or objective system. This server


### Install on your server
We know that we don't and propably also won't have the budget to become a big server network that you would play on daily, so our focus is on developing and distributing the game mode just like things like MineZ. At the moment there's no installer for easily getting the gamemode installed on your server. If you're interested in adding Mineglory to your Server please contact me at paperbenni@gmail.com
