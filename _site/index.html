    <h1>Welcome to Mineglory</h1>
    Mineglory is planned to be a moba server for Minecraft following the gameplay elements of Games like League of Legends or
    VainGlory. 
    <h1>Why does the IP change a lot?</h1>
    <p>
        We don't take any money from you, everyone gets the same gameplay experience
        without buying any pay to win crates. That's why we have to rely on free hosting services. We'd have to pay about 5$
        per month per server instance to get static ip's which is in my oppinion not worth it. If we're one day opeing a patreon,
        all the money goes into better hositng options first. 
    </p>
    <h2>Not-Even-Alpha</h2>
    <p>
        This server is more than unfinished. The map
        is about 20% complete and there's currently no working teaming or objective system. This server ### Install on your server
        We know that we don't and propably also won't have the budget to become a big server network that you would play on daily,
        so our focus is on developing and distributing the game mode just like things like MineZ. At the moment there's no installer
        for easily getting the gamemode installed on your server. If you're interested in adding Mineglory to your Server please
        contact me at paperbenni@gmail.com
